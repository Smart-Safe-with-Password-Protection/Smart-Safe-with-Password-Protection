# Smart Safe with Password Protection

## Overview
Smart Safe with Password Protection is an advanced security system designed to protect your valuables. The system features password protection to ensure only authorized individuals can access the safe. It utilizes a microcontroller to handle the password input and locking mechanism.

## Features
- **Password Protection**: Ensures only authorized access to the safe.
- **Microcontroller-Based**: Utilizes a microcontroller for secure and efficient operation.
- **Simulation**: Provides a simulation of the safe's operation for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Microcontroller (e.g., PIC)
- MPLAB IDE for programming the microcontroller
- Proteus for simulation


### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Smart-Safe-with-Password-Protection/Smart-Safe-with-Password-Protection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Smart-Safe-with-Password-Protection
   ```

### Running the Simulation
1. Open the project in Proteus.
2. Load the microcontroller program into the simulation.
3. Run the simulation to test the safe's operations.

## Usage
1. Power on the safe.
2. Enter the password using the keypad.
3. If the password is correct, the safe will unlock.
4. If the password is incorrect, the safe will remain locked. After three failed attempts, an email alert with a photo of the person attempting access will be sent to the owner.
